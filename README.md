# Caculator
A website where you can use a calculator. It works to add numbers, subtract numbers, multiply numbers and divide numbers. If you need to clear all or delete some numbers, then there is a button for that too.

## What I learned 🧠
- Pleasing `Design`
- How to select HTML element in the `DOM`
- Heavily focused on the JavaScript `conditionals` (if/else if/else)
-  Working with `functions`
